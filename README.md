## Summary:
- LangChain helps in simple AI Assistant & Memory Based app and for chaining (LCEL).
- using LangChain it creates only DAG(Direct Acyclic Graph).</Br>
On OtherHand</Br>
- LangGraph helps in simple AI Assistant to complex Agentic pattern.
- Using LangGraph it creates DCG(Direct Cyclic Graph).
